in PATCH/DELETE

<form>
<input id="hidden" type="hidden" name="_method" value="PATCH/DELETE">
</form>

A few questions:



I want to be able to do something like -
  Number of players returns a range but then also adds that number of input fields when creating a new match

  2 - 4 -> 3 -> creates 3 player input fields in new match form
  can select from existing players

  game.num_of_players -> inputs num_of_players fields in new match

  game.match.player.score -> Catan.4.Tyler.score = 17
  game.match.all
  game.match.winner -> Azul.5867.winner = "Fei"
